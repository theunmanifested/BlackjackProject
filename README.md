## Blackjack Project

### Description
This program is a fun and classic blackjack game. The participants are a Dealer and a Player, and they both try to reach a count of 21 without going over. The player has optional choices on how to reach 21, and the dealer has predefined set of mandates on how to proceed depending on its initial dealt blackjack hand. The program allows for one playthrough at a time.
