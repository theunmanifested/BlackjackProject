/*  Storyline or Pseudocode practice. Step by step account to better design and implement a application
 *  
 * Player enters a casino, finds a Blackjack table, and sits down to play.
 * Player requests to play Blackjack with Basic rules (see Basic Rules below). Perhaps later he/she will go to another 
 * table where the rules are more complicated (Stretch Goals). The usual steps for a game of blackjack ensues:
 * 1. The Dealer produces a Deck, shuffles it, and 
 * 2. Dealer gives out two Hands: 
 * 	a. Player with two cards facing up, 
 *  b. Dealer gets two cards with one facing up, and one facing down. 
 * 3. Player makes a choice to:
 *  a. Hit
 *  b. Stand
 * 4. Player wins if:
 *  a. Hand total is 21, and Dealer's hand total is not 21
 *  b. Hand total is higher than Dealer after dealer Stands
 *  c. Dealer busts
 * 5. Dealer wins if:
 * 	a. Hand total is 21, and Player's hand total is not 21
 *  b. Hand total is higher after Player stands
 *  c. Player busts
 * 6. Tie if both hands total is 21
 * 
 *  Object-Orientated Programming Design:
 *  
 * Classes:
 * - Card  - Rank  - Suit  - Deck  
 * - Hand (Abstact)  - Blackjack Hand
 * - Dealer  - Player
 * - Blackjack Application (this)
 *  
 * 
 * Basic Rules:
 *  - Aces value is 11
 *  - Dealer's total >= 17 must Stand, if total <= 16 must Hit
 *  - No Splitting
 *  - No Double-Down
 *  - No maximum of cards in hand *
